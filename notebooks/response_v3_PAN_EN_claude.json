With so many now injured by modern medicine , I am very keen to hear how other types of healing practices work . Especially if holistic practitioners have any ideas or strategies to help those injured by the Covid - 19 vaccines . What I have realised is that we medically trained doctors really need to acknowledge that human beings are more than matter ; we are both matter and energy . This in turn means acknowledging that we feel and sense things that scientific instruments can not necessarily measure , that we exist within a universe we know little about and that there are ways of healing that our modern scientific methods can not yet elaborate . Homeopathy is one of these modalities . From a medical and materialistic perspective , homeopathy makes no sense , and yet , it clearly works . In this week \u2019s Tess Talks , homeopath Janey Lavelle took me through the rationale behind homeopathy and made the salient point that this particular medicine is based on energy and frequency . Now , if one takes the view that we are but matter , then homeopathy is illogical . If one entertains the reality that we are matter and energy , then homeopathy suddenly starts to make sense . Once I grasped the principles of this two - century old healing system with Janey \u2019s help , we began to talk about the possibilities it brings . This is where it got really fascinating . Janey , together with many other homeopaths , is successfully treating people injured by vaccines and has been doing so for years . I was particularly struck by homeopathy \u2019s use of isopathy and nosodes to treat vaccine injury , both of which she explains in our conversation . It got me thinking : what if a generic remedy could be used for each of the Pfizer , Astra Zeneca , Johnson & Johnson , Moderna and other vaccines to counter their ill effects ? What if this could be available over the counter as a kind of panacea for the Covid vaccine injury pandemic ? Perhaps homeopaths are already working on this . Given the deafening silence from and apparent cluelessness of mainstream medicine , I truly hope so . I really loved speaking with Janey . She \u2019s a mother of four with a wealth of life experience , woman \u2019s wisdom and healing expertise . What she has to share is important : trust in modern western medicine is at an all - time low , allopathic doctors are at a loss as to how to treat the increasing numbers of vaccine - injured people , and we all need to inform ourselves of the alternative avenues to health restoration . I really hope my colleagues will tune in with an open mind , and consider referring people who they can not heal , to homeopaths . Just because we do n\u2019t understand something , does not mean it is not real , or can not work . Do n\u2019t miss my next Tess Talks this Sunday morning with homeopath Janey Lavelle \u2013 and please share with anyone you think may be interested . Talking about new approaches to health and having spoken about community last week , brings me to a new organisation working hard to bring these two themes together . The People \u2019s Health Alliance ( PHA ) is driving the development of decentralised community health hubs across the UK and internationally . Their Health Hub Blueprint is available , free of charge , to download when you sign up to their newsletter , and it offers a comprehensive guide to creating your own health hub \u2013 if one has n\u2019t been established in your community already . From the African Sovereignty Coalition to People \u2019s Health Alliance and everything in between , these initiatives are how we bring change from the ground up . If you have n\u2019t already , I warmly encourage you to find out what \u2019s happening in your area and connect , face to face and heart to heart with your community .

The owner is local physician , amateur archeologist and geologist Dr. Javier Cabrera Darquea . Most material employed is a gray andesite , an extremely hard granitic semi - crystalline matrix , that is very difficult to carve . They were first seen and recorded by Jesuit missionary Father Simon , who accompanied Pizarro in 1525 . Samples were shipped to Spain in 1562 . The stone portraits show very sophisticated surgery skills and medical knowledge , in some cases as advanced , and even more advanced , than today .
